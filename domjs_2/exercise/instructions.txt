You can watch the video here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bOO1DfWiQ9o
Find the github repo here: https://github.com/codingwithdax/exercises/tree/main/domjs_2

Try running the solution in the solution directory (don't look at the code):

exercises/domjs_2/solution

You can see the expected behavior there.

Now implement the solution by adding the button, text fields and javascript

If you get stuck, watch the video or peek at the solution.

Thanks for trying it out!
